# sudoku_solver
My first programming steps, yay. Sudoku Solver will receive as inpun an unsolved (but solvable) 9x9 matrix of numbers (1-9) and run its' algorithm to solve it. Algorithm will be split into two parts: analytic solving - using reduction of possible candidates, and brute-force solving - when analytic analysis won't be able to give a valid result.
